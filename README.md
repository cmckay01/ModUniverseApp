# ModUniverseApp

## Description
The ModUniverseApp is an educational tool designed to simulate the gravitational interactions and orbital mechanics of celestial bodies. It leverages Newtonian physics to accurately model the movements and interactions of planets and other astronomical objects in a solar system.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of gravitational forces and celestial movements.
- Interactive control for adding, removing, and adjusting the properties of celestial bodies.
- Newtonian physics formulas for precise calculation of gravitational interactions.
- Advanced physics algorithms including Runge-Kutta methods for accurate orbital simulations.
- Educational tool for understanding and demonstrating orbital mechanics.
